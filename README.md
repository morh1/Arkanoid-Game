# Arkanoid-Game
### ***Overview:***
This is an implementation of the classic Arkanoid game in Java. <br>
I developed this project as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course, at Bar Ilan University.<br>
The game contains 4 levels with increasing difficulty and is implemented in a GUI-friendly platform.<br>
demonstrating the power of OOP design patterns in creating a flexible and modular game structure.<br>

### ***About:***
The objective of Arkanoid is to control a paddle to bounce a ball and break a wall of bricks.<br>
Your goal is to clear all the bricks on the screen and prevent the ball from falling off the bottom of the play area.<br>
### ***Gameplay:***
** 1. Start of the Game:** The game begins with the ball placed on the paddle at the bottom of the screen.<br>
A wall of bricks is located at the top of the screen.<br>
**2. Bouncing the Ball:** Once the ball is launched, it will start bouncing around the screen.<br>
The ball will bounce off the walls, the paddle, and the bricks.<br>
**3. Breaking Bricks:** Your goal is to hit and break all the bricks on the screen using the ball.<br>
Each brick has a certain number of hits required to break it.<br>
When the ball hits a brick, the brick's hit count decreases, and the ball changes direction.<br>
**4. Paddle Control:** Move the paddle left and right to keep the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen.<br>
If the ball falls off the bottom, you lose a life.<br>
**5. Power-Ups:** Some bricks release power-ups when hit.<br>
Power-ups can include larger paddles, multiple balls, or increased ball speed.<br>
To collect a power-up, simply let the ball hit it as it falls down.<br>
**6. Completing Levels:** Once all the bricks on the screen are broken, you advance to the next level.<br>
Each level may have a different arrangement of bricks.<br>
**7. Losing a Life:** You have a limited number of lives. You lose a life when the ball falls off the bottom of the screen.<br>
After losing a life, the ball will be placed on the paddle again, and you can continue playing from where you left off.<br>
**8. Game Over:** The game is over when you run out of lives.<br>
Your final score is based on the number of bricks you've broken and any points earned from power-ups.<br>
