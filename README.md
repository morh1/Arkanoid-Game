# Arkanoid-Game üíúüê†
### ***Overview:***
This is an implementation of the classic Arkanoid game in Java. <br>
I developed this project as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course, at Bar Ilan University.<br>
The game contains 4 levels with increasing difficulty and is implemented in a GUI-friendly platform.<br>
demonstrating the power of OOP design patterns in creating a flexible and modular game structure.<br>

### ***About:***
The objective of Arkanoid is to control a paddle to bounce a ball and break a wall of bricks.<br>
Your goal is to clear all the bricks on the screen and prevent the ball from falling off the bottom of the play area.<br>
### ***Gameplay:***
**1. Start of the Game:** The game begins with the ball placed on the paddle at the bottom of the screen.<br>
A wall of bricks is located at the top of the screen.<br>
**2. Bouncing the Ball:** Once the ball is launched, it will start bouncing around the screen.<br>
The ball will bounce off the walls, the paddle, and the bricks.<br>
**3. Breaking Bricks:** Your goal is to hit and break all the bricks on the screen using the ball.<br>
Each brick has a certain number of hits required to break it.<br>
When the ball hits a brick, the brick's hit count decreases, and the ball changes direction.<br>
**4. Paddle Control:** Move the paddle left and right to keep the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen.<br>
If the ball falls off the bottom, you lose a life.<br>
**5. Completing Levels:** Once all the bricks on the screen are broken, you advance to the next level.<br>
Each level may have a different arrangement of bricks.<br>
**8. Game Over:** The game is over when you run out of balls.<br>
Your final score is based on the number of bricks you've broken and any points earned from power-ups.<br>
### ***Levels:***
* Level 1: Direct Hit
* Level 2: sunshine
* Level 3: under the sea
* Level 4: Space
### ***Running the project:***
1. Clone the project to your machine.<br>
2. Run the `Ass6Game` class, which is located in the src directory of the project.
